The Kiota abstractions Library for PHP is the PHP library defining the basic constructs Kiota projects need once an SDK has been generated from an OpenAPI definition.

A [Kiota](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota) generated project will need a reference to the abstraction package to build and run.

Read more about Kiota [here](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota/blob/main/README.md).

## Using the Abstractions Library
run `composer require microsoft/kiota-abstractions` or add the following to your `composer.json` file:

```Shell
{
    "require": {
        "microsoft/kiota-abstractions": "^1.4.0"
    }
}
```
